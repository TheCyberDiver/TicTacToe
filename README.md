### Why make a TicTacToe
  I made this project to showcase my ability to understand OOP concepts, using methods, critical thinking, and commenting code. It was a blast following Alex Lees tutorial.
  
### How-To
  This is a console based game. Replace the file in your src folder with this one and click run. You will be asked to place an X at a position 1-9 and will be stored in the 2D array. Through each iteration it will check for a winner. 

### What's next?
  I will be studying for an upcoming exam but after will be coding an ATM without following an outline in Java and then Python.
  After that I will come back to this project and modify it to make it my own!
